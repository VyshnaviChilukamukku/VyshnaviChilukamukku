â€¢	ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vyshnavi Ch, an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate from 2022 with a passion for VLSI design.

â€¢	I've gained valuable experience during my time at Harman India and at Maven Silicon where I delved into the intricacies of electronics and communication systems.

â€¢	ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in RTL Design and Verification, with a focus on Computer Architecture, Microarchitecture and Domain-Specific Architecture.

Previous Work/Projects:
1.	RISC V (RV32I) RTL Design
2.	AMBA AHB2APB Bridge Verification using UVM Methodology in SystemVerilog
3.	Router 1X3 Design and Verification using UVM Methodology in SystemVerilog
4.	8-bit microcontroller RTL Design.

ðŸ“š Additionally, Iâ€™m continuously working on miscellaneous projects, and Iâ€™ll be updating my profile with new additions soon.
